# Ocean Cleanup Vehicle Controls Application
*Team Members: Matthew Armstrong, William Fitzgerald, Jake Gustafson, and Amy Law*

Incorporates BluetoothÂ® and location services to operate a vehicle used for ocean cleanup. See the vehicle's associated firmware and hardware components [here](https://github.com/matthewarmstr/ocean-cleanup-rov-controls.cydsn).

This project was developed as part of our UC Davis ECS 193 Senior Design Project in coordination with an EEC 136 design team. Special thanks to Professor Christopher Nitta and Teaching Assistant Ajay Suresh for their guidance and support throughout the project.

## Interface Overview
The application utilizes two views. The initial view presents a list of all available bluetooth devices advertising a service UUID that corresponds to our associated firmware. On selection of a peripheral from the list, users are navigated to a controls view. The controls view presents buttons to open the trash gate, start the motor, and move the fin so that the boat moves left or right. This view also provides the distance to the peripheral from the user (rightmost element), the distance between the boat and the nearest object ahead of it, and the direction relative to true north that the boat is from the user.
